# EDA on Crypto Data

This repository contains the code and documentation for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the `crypto.csv` file. The EDA was conducted using the `crypto_da.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.

## Data

The `crypto.csv` file contains information on various cryptocurrencies, including their names, symbols, market caps, and prices. The data was obtained from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).

## Code

## Results

The EDA yielded several interesting insights into the cryptocurrency market, including:

- The top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP, and Solana.
